    <h2>What is Cursive Data?</h2>
<p>The project started as a way of making energy usage data more accessible to people not interested in graphs or numbers.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="{% url cursivedata:list_sources %}">real time data</a> is received one of a number of <a href="{% url cursivedata:list_generators %}">pattern generators</a> is used to create a new frame that becomes part of a slowly growing <a href="{% url cursivedata:list_pipelines %}">visualisation</a>.
</p>
<p>
The visualisations can simply be embedded onto a website, or more interestingly brought to life by a drawing robot.

<p>
The robots are wall hanging v-plotters or polargraphs. They are designed to exhibit your data in a beautiful way.
A <a href="http://mattvenn.net/files/Polargraph_MattVenn.pdf">document further explaining the idea is available here.</a>

<p>
<a href="http://bristolgreencapital.org/">Bristol Green Capital</a> funded the project to develop this website and install a public robot that will draw energy data.
